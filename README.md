# Hotel Booking Analysis
## Overview 
Making a hotel reservation gives visitors the ability to plan their arrival and departure dates, accommodation preferences, extras, and payment methods all in one location. There are various methods available for reserving hotels, including Direct, Online/Offline TA/TO, etc. inside the EDA undertaking. A "Hotel Bookings" data collection was given to me to examine and learn from.

I adhered to the project's step-by-step methodology, which included gathering data, organizing it, visualizing it, and coming to a decision. To gain a general understanding of the data, we first gathered information and examined the data set. I cleansed the raw data during the data wrangling phase by substituting meaningful values for the null values. duplicate rows were eliminated, column data types were formatted, and some columns for our analysis.Initially the number of columns and rows were 119390 and 32 respectively.
## Data Wrangling
Data wrangling refers to the process of cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data into a desired format for better decision-making in analysis. It's often considered the most time-consuming task in data science projects, but it's crucial for ensuring that data is in a usable state for analysis or modeling. Here's an overview of the steps involved in data wrangling:

**Data Collection:** Obtain data from various sources such as databases, APIs, spreadsheets, or web scraping.

**Data Cleaning:** This step involves identifying and handling missing data, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and dealing with outliers.

**Data Transformation:** Convert data into a suitable format for analysis. This may include converting data types, normalizing or scaling data, and handling categorical variables through techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

**Data Integration:** Merge or join data from multiple sources if necessary. This step ensures that all relevant data is consolidated into a single dataset.

**Data Reduction:** Sometimes, datasets may contain redundant or irrelevant information. Data reduction techniques like feature selection or dimensionality reduction can help streamline the dataset while retaining important information.

**Data Enrichment:** Enhance the dataset by adding additional information from external sources. This could involve merging with demographic data, enriching with geospatial information, or deriving new features from existing ones.

**Data Validation:** Ensure the integrity and quality of the data through validation checks. This may involve verifying data against predefined rules or conducting statistical analyses to detect anomalies.
