# Hotel Booking Analysis
## Overview 
Making a hotel reservation gives visitors the ability to plan their arrival and departure dates, accommodation preferences, extras, and payment methods all in one location. There are various methods available for reserving hotels, including Direct, Online/Offline TA/TO, etc. inside the EDA undertaking. A "Hotel Bookings" data collection was given to me to examine and learn from.

I adhered to the project's step-by-step methodology, which included gathering data, organizing it, visualizing it, and coming to a decision. To gain a general understanding of the data, we first gathered information and examined the data set. I cleansed the raw data during the data wrangling phase by substituting meaningful values for the null values. duplicate rows were eliminated, column data types were formatted, and some columns for our analysis.Initially the number of columns and rows were 119390 and 32 respectively.
